A variant strategy is written at the end.)\n\n*   *   On game start, declare interests in Italy and Occitania, use Enlistment Efforts decrees on both your states and conscript the maximum amount of troops, then queue General Staff into Nationalism for research.\n\n*   *   When your interests have established, use a Power Bloc Embassy treaty to get money transfer (aim for ~2k) from any of the Sovereign Empire Power Bloc leaders that are protective towards you. Upon establishing this treaty, start a Diplomatic Play against Sardinia-Piedmont to conquer all of their states. For the war against Sardinia-Piedmont, you will likely have more success defending until you have General Staff, but with the conscription from National Militia you should be able to reduce their troop numbers more than they can reduce yours.\n\n*   *   After winning the war, incorporate Savoy and set an interest in Persia. Conquer Bahraini Hormuz from Bahrain. After conquering this state, incorporating Savoy, and researching Nationalism, change your capital to Savoy and release Sardinia-Piedmont as a subject. Grant it Sardinia and Provence, then use the Trade State interaction to give it East and West Switzerland. Declare war on France (Expel Diplomats if necessary) and they should set a \"Conquer Savoy\" wargoal as a primary. Back down to their demands and your capital will move to your only remaining state: Hormuz. Your GDP should be >10k at this point and you will be receiving ~2k in money transfer treaties so the achievement will pop.\n\n*   Alternatively, improve relations with all neighbors except [![Flag of France](https://vic3.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/9/92/Flag_FRA.png/24px-Flag_FRA.png)](/France \"France\") [France](/France \"France\").

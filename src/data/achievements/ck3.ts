Ensure that all of the county holders in your realm within Africa are converted to the proper faith.

    "notes": "Although the steam achievement states Norse tribal, the in-game achievement has been changed to allow any government type, including Jarl Haesteinn who is now feudal. This will still trigger the steam achievement.\n\nStarting as Jarl Haesteinn in 867 use the Duchy conquest casus belli to seize Sicily while they are at war with the Byzantines. Move your capital to Palermo and start conquering small independent Counts and Dukes. For Byzantine territories, wait for a weakness or make allies to match their strength and use the Kingdom conquest casus belli to take all of the land in one war, since it could be a costly war keep it for the end. Alternatively, after taking enough non-Byzantine and Italian land to create the Kingdom, swear fealty to the Byzantines and the emperor should grant you the remaining de-jure counties in the Kingdom of Sicily. Follow this with an independence war when having a stronge enough faction or enough allies.\n\nAnother approach (if the [![Roads to Power](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/e/ed/DLC_Roads_to_Power.png/24px-DLC_Roads_to_Power.png)](/Roads_to_Power \"Roads to Power\") Roads to Power DLC is NOT installed, which keeps the Byzantines Feudal) would be to swear fealty to the Byzantine Emperor after you have seized Sicily, start by conquering the smaller independent realms and vassals of the Byzantine empire. You should modify your feudal contract to protect yourself from title revocation, you can always add religious rights to your contract later. You will then have to break away from the empire eventually and can do this via an independence faction, use your spy master to find hooks on the various dukes in the empire so you can force them to join. A few assassinations can also destabilize the empire. Once you are independent the achievement should fire."

Hire mercenaries to fight for you to not waste your special soldiers, hire one company for the county war and save your money for later. If you capture any important couriers, make sure to ransom them for some extra money, which means extra soldiers.\n\nWhen you are ready, declare war on The Byzantine Empire with the Invade Kingdom casus belli and select Thessalonika. Preferably wait until The Byzantine Emprie is at war or deals with rebellions. Priortize sieging down counties close to the objective and preferably inside the objective. Eventually you will have to face the armies of The Byzantine Empire, defending will most times just about make you win, but getting them to cross a strait (for example between Kalliopolis and Lampsakos) will greatly increase your chances of winning. If you reset your perks at the start, you can chose to go the Gallant path. This will help with overal combat and decrese the war-score needed to win the war.\n\nYou can now go on and create any empire you want. The Empire of Ajuraan only needs 18 counties and you can reach High Chiefdom of Naqis to not deal with The Tulunid Sultanate and The Abbasid Empire.  \nAccept any Peasent Rabble's as it is way less trouble to have the lowered controll than dealing with the rebels, as you won't gain a lot of money from tax.  \nAllying some big kingdoms with lots of men will help discourage The Byzantine Empire to retake provinces. Fortunately, most times they will implode."

    "notes": "The fastest way to adopt Feudalism is to use the \"**Adopt Feudal Ways through Liege**\" decision. Conquer land in Poland until you are stronger than the ruler of Great Moravia. Then border Great Moravia and convert to Catholicism so the leader will want to take you as a vassal. Swear fealty to Great Moravia and take the decision to become feudal. At this point either fight for independence to be able to form Poland or take over Great Moravia from within. Either way, make sure you own and keep the Kingdom of Poland.\n\nThe artifacts can be acquired by sponsoring their creation yourself, and by taking them from others. To get more Inspired characters, raise court grandeur, switch to a Scholarly court, and get the first Erudition dynasty legacy. Periodically use the character finder to search for characters with inventory artifacts, sorting by rank, and focusing on emperors and kings. With the [Accomplished Forger perk](/Lifestyle#Diplomat \"Lifestyle\"), buy claims on their artifacts, then demand the artifacts, steal them or go to war for them."

To allow for more vassalization, sway the targets, and create the kingdoms that are de jure above them. Focus on wealth for faster title creation. Mjinjaa is not necessary to create the empire, but can be subjugated with a high enough level of fame; if this is the goal, prioritize prestige & fame instead of gold.\n\nNamdé Ösung of Gugé in 867 is also viable. Be reminded that the faith Namdé Ösung follows does have the tenet \"Dharmic Pacifism\" which disallows you to fight holy wars.

This means that an AI whose religious group is different from yours or whose capital is outside of your capital's region will not adopt your court's language.\n\nTo keep a vassal king from changing culture to the local culture, or change an existing vassal king's culture, you can convert the culture of their capital county. The AI will switch culture to their liege's if their capital county is the same culture as their liege's. However, the AI is biased towards keeping their current court language. If after sometime the AI doesn't switch their court language to yours, revoke the kingdom title and give it to a character of your culture.\n\nConsider starting as Charles the Bald in 867. You start with claims on three additional kingdoms held by your much weaker relatives, and once conquered you will be in a great position to take the \"Restore Carolingian Borders\" decision giving you a huge de jure empire (and more importantly, the Primogeniture succession law) very early on. From there, just have fun conquering!"

Or simply reform Bori to have that tenet.\n\nAlternatively, start as Jarl Haesteinn in 867. Immediately assign your steward to convert the County of Montaigu to Norse culture and your Godi (Realm Priest) to fabricate a claim on the County of Fika. In the mean time, use the \"Conquer County\" Casus Belli for the County of Melilla to secure a foothold in Africa. Next, use the \"Conquer County\" Casus Belli to take the County of Zammour, which grants the diplomatic range to declare war on coastal Sub-Saharan holdings. Declare another \"Conquer County\" war for any Sub-Saharan coastal holding of your choosing, but be careful not to lose Haesteinn's special event troops to attrition. You may now enforce your claim on the County of Fika. After taking the County of Fika and converting the County of Montaigu to Norse culture, select the title \"County of Fika,\" and make it your primary title. Diverge the Norse culture.

Alternately, become emperor and revoke or create the duchies, and ensure none are lost on succession while you lose the empire. Make sure no one from the Etichonen dynasty is elected as the emperor.\n\nIntrigue Path: Start as Werner in Aargau, marry your son into the duchy of Austria, and become an intrigue-focused character. Murder the two sons who would inherit instead. Then, as you receive the duchy with your grandchildren, use your bishop to constantly get claims on the Steyermark duchy and petition for it from your liege. Or try to marry into the family and once again get your heir to inherit both titles.\n\nGrand Weddings have a chance to give you a strong hook on your liege, which you need for the [Archduchy of Austria decision](/Ruler_decisions#Form_Archduchy_of_Austria \"Ruler decisions\"), and the first Dynasty legacy of 'Activities' increases that chance (make sure the emperor isn't busy and will attend when planning the weddings). Alternatively, you can get the \"Ritualized Friendship\" tradition for your culture, and Swear Oath of True Friendship with the Emperor. Strong hooks can also sometimes be fabricated.\n\nAll wars where you are not the primary aggressor (the character who declared the war) are allowed, including tyranny wars from imprisoning or revoking, factions against you, crusades, or ally's wars."

Change the county capital to the holding with the mine if necessary.\n\nThe barony's income is indicated as \"Tax\" in the Holding view. \"Monthly Income\" modifiers like Greedy or Wealth Focus are irrelevant. Increase \"Taxes\" with buildings, high personal stewardship, Tax Offices in the duchy building slot (+15-30%), increasing Development, and Collecting Taxes with a skilled steward. You can get the Avaricious trait (+15%) and the Absolute Control perk (+10%), and be the Steward of your liege (+10% if emperor). A common event while traveling through another ruler's province with the Cattle Pastures building can give the Improved Pastures modifier (+20%) to your capital.

Begin the scheme as soon as possible as the remit will expire if the emperor dies.

Complete contracts for Strategos Ioannes II until you manage to get a hook on him. Then purchase an estate using the Procure Estate option, you will require 1000 gold and a weak hook. Then you must acquire a Theme. You desperately need the money and connections. Some of the Themes can easily be acquired by promoting yourself and slandering others, so pick an easy one (check the succession score first) and go for it. Once you have a Theme, you can either acquire a claim on the Empire through the Meritocracy Perk, or you can play as an Administrative vassal and work towards the throne legitimately.\n\nDoing this will essentially require boosting your House within the realm. Once you have adult children, start working on getting them to the front of succession for other Themes besides your own. At the same time, ensure your heir is in line for your personal Theme, and start Boundary Disputes against neighboring vassals (preferably those belonging to Powerful Families) to take more and more land. Upgrade your Estate and constantly build buildings within your realm (this gives Influence), and just keep building your Family's power. Once powerful enough, you can start working on getting yourself in line for the Empire. Rinse and repeat the process of getting a Theme in the first place until you're the top candidate. Then, murder the Emperor. It may be helpful to murder candidates with insurmountable succession scores; if this is something you want to do, take the Skullduggery Focus of the Intrigue lifestyle. The biggest threat to this achivement is getting kicked out of governorship due to having no adult children. Consider starting as a custom adventurer that does have adult children to avoid this. Children cannot be promoted for Theme Governorship at all. As of May 2025 with the [![Khans of the Steppe](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/9/97/DLC_Khans_of_the_Steppe.png/24px-DLC_Khans_of_the_Steppe.png)](/Khans_of_the_Steppe \"Khans of the Steppe\") Khans of the Steppe DLC it is NOT recommended to start in 1178. The Mongol Empire's new mechanics under this DLC will usually result in this achievement becoming de facto impossible, as you will be reduced to an adventurer who is rivals with the Khan (making it impossible to acquire land within the Byzantine de jure) if you cannot acquire the Empire before the Mongol Onslaught begins, which is essentially impossible without copious luck. Consider starting in 1066 or 867; it will take longer to get the gold, but you will not have to deal with the extremely powerful Mongols and have a much better shot of taking the Empire.\n\nAlternatively, disable the DLC."

Stay in Persia, build up your piety (via pilgrimages, using the Prolific Pilgrims perk in the learning tree) and army, but don't take the decision to evangelize. Eventually you get called to Cairo. Once there, continue to build up an army (as large as possible) and wait for the Egyptian Caliph to die; this triggers another story event that allows you to convert to Nizarism. Always choose options that say \"advance you down the path.\"\n\nEventually another event will appear which will send you back to Persia; now it is time to Evangelize as much as possible, as you will recieve special soldiers scaling to the number of counties of your faith in the realm. At this point it is a good idea to wait for the Persian Emperor to die as his successor will be much weaker. Do not select the current Emperor as the enemy of the faith when prompted. Decline it until the young emperor becomes your option. Once this happens, found the Assassins and wait for civil wars to happen. You can then begin the revolution, which will typically result in an easy victory as the emperor deals with rebels. You can continue to evangelize or spread the Assassins if you wish, to make things easier. Must be completed during the lifetime of Hasan Sabbah."

Also, the Khazars could be a pain to deal with, since they can occupy most of the western steppe, but there usually should be at least one county be either independent or herder. The only other concern is gold and the army. If you have too many MAAs, you could have negative income after shrinking from a duke to a count, yet you still need a good army to deal with enemies.

A high Martial Education, the Military Engineer and Organizer Traits are also desirable.\n\nSet your Kurultai to Increase Control if necessary and to Support Herders or Manage Fertility otherwise. If you need Piety a Pilgrimage is more effective than Aid Stargazer.\n\nMake sure you have competent people in your Caravan Master, Noyan and Keeper of the Horses Court Positions and set their tasks to Prepare Armies, Cow Vassals and Warhorse Grooming.\n\nDo a Nerge Hunt each year (Hunt Activity cooldown is reduced by 50% because of Prolific Hunters Cultural Tradition) with Substantial Party Size Activity Option. Always pick the options on maxing out the success scoring first to get an Excellent Nerge Outcome.This is your main source of Gold, Prestige and Legitimacy. Nomadic rulers can move their Realm Capital as often as they want so you can move it close to the activity destination to have less travel time. Exclude Vassal and Tributary Guests to reduce how long you have to wait until it starts. Migrate to more fertile lands if you have done a Nerge Hunt in all of your realm counties.\n\nCreate Men-at-Arms and improve your Realm Capital. Focus on Heavy Horse Archers and Torch Bearers Regiments as well as Domicile Buildings increasing Herd Capacity, Herd Gain, County Fertility and Army Movement Speed.\n\nInbetween Nerge Hunts you can wage war with the Nomadic Quarrels, Bring under Tribute and Expand Dominance Casus Belli to grow your realm.\n\nContinue to Demand Vassalization and Tributaries, change Contracts to higher Herd Tithes, Demand Submission, Demand Horses and give Vassal Directives to increase County Fertility. Do not accept Vassals too remote from Mongolia to keep your Realm compact and avoid easy occupation targets for your war opponents.\n\nOffering to join wars on Tributaries defending against rulers from other Realms, hosting a Tsagaan Sar Feast, Funeral or Grand Tournament are also good ways to collect Prestige and opinion.\n\nRaiding and Stealing Herd can also increase your resources but will reduce opinion so preferably ignore those options.\n\nContinue until you can increase your Dominance and take Dominate Title and ultimately the Become the Greatest of Khans decisions. The ensuing Wars can have a Battle Won Score which is capped at 100% so focus on defeating the opposing hordes while you capture two or three holdings of them with a separate army. Opposing armies will attack your realm from multiple angles and attempt to retreat when they notice your army approaching which is why your Army Movement Speed is so important.\n\nPick Strategist Perks and Nomadic Dynasty Legacies as they become available. After you've fully unlocked the Strategist Perk Tree switch to Diplomacy Lifestile Focus and aim for the True Ruler Perk.\n\nIf you want the helpful Paiza System change the Cultural Fascination to Ledger as soon as you become the Cultural Head and if you have enough Prestige to spare reform Mongol by establishing the Horse Breeders (Warfare) and later on the Iron Cavalry (Regional) Cultural Traditions.\n\nMake sure to not to accidentaly take the Move into Conquered Lands, Settle the Steppe, Forsake Nomadism or Convert to Local Culture Decisions."

Getting to 75 Cohesion is relatively easy, but after that point it is extremely hard to gain Cohesion.\n\nThe easiest way to gain free Cohesion is by hosting or attending Festival activities with the Encourage Cohesion Intent. Spam Festivals as much as possible. The other way to gain Cohesion is through passive House Relations. Within your Bloc, you want the fewest number of landed rulers possible, and ideally the fewest number of Houses, unless each House has an excellent relation with the other. You also need every House to have the same Aspiration - use the \"Demand Aspiration Change\" interaction if one is different. It is probably easiest to do this in a Bloc of 2 Houses - your own, and one more.\n\nPositive House Relation modifiers can be gained through events, gifting gold to the House Head, or inter-House marriages. Don't do anything to harm the House Relations and work towards the highest possible relation with all of your Bloc Houses. Then, simply wait (while still spamming Festivals) until Cohesion reaches 100."

This will cause your Bloc Cohesion to rapidly rise, and a Cohesion of 75 is required for the next step of the achievement.\n\nOnce your Bloc has greater military strength than the current Daijo-daijin, start an \"Install Ruling Regent\" faction and press your demands. Win the war if necessary, and relish in your new title as Daijo-daijin. You now have to meet a few conditions, including having both Legitimacy and Prestige at level 4, and having the third level of crown authority (Powerful Ministries) - Japan starts at level 2. These are relatively easy to accomplish with activities, and once met, you can take the Formalize Shogunate decision. Must be accomplished within the lifetime of Minamoto no Yorimoto."

    "notes": "There are two ways to go about this, which differ based on the starting date, your patience, and whether you'd like to enjoy some historical flavor. Do not start in 1178, as the realm will already be Feudal (Soryo) and the achievement will be quite difficult.\n\nStarting in 867 as Korehito, use political schemes and influence to get yourself to the front of the line of succession as soon as possible. The reigning Kampaku is old and will die within a few years of game start. Once elected to the regency, choose to abdicate, passing the ceremonial throne to your heir whilst keeping control over the Empire itself (this is a historical method of imperial rule that Japan actually used for a while).\n\nYou now want to ensure your heir is first in line for the Empire, whilst biding your time as you await the Early Medieval era and the Royal Prerogative innovation. Once you have this innovation and have subsequently died and started playing as your heir (who must now hold both the Empire and the Chrysanthemum Throne--DO NOT abdicate), you will be able to pass the third level of crown authority and take the decision. Starting as Chikahito in 1066, you can either use politics to be elected to the throne as above (difficult as there are less Japanese rulers in 1066 with access to influence to help you), or use the Depose scheme (Intrigue lifestyle focus will help with this) to overthrow the ruling Kampaku. Either way, once on the throne you should already have access to the decision, if not, use activities to boost prestige to enact the requisite laws and take the decision. If starting in this date, do not abdicate upon ascending the throne - you already have Royal Prerogative unlocked and there is no need to abdicate to ensure your line can stay on the throne."
